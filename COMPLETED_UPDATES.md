# Completed Updates - Session 2

## ✅ All 4 Priority Features Implemented!

### 1. Streak Logic Update (#12) ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
- Created `updateStreakOnActivity()` helper function
- Streak now ONLY increments when:
  - User adds a new question
  - User adds a new snippet
- Removed automatic streak update on dashboard load
- `/api/user/update-streak` now just returns current streak

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Added helper function and integrated with POST endpoints

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Streak updates on question add
app.post("/api/questions") → updateStreakOnActivity(userId)

// Streak updates on snippet add  
app.post("/api/snippets") → updateStreakOnActivity(userId)

// Dashboard just reads streak, doesn't update
app.post("/api/user/update-streak") → returns current streak
```
